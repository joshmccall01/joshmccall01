- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Josh McCall.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve only just started my programming journey and I'm loving it so far. I've completed the Responsive Web Design course on freecodecamp and I've dabbled with a bit of python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m now moving on to the JavaScript course while working through a few HTML/CSS and Python projects.
- :nerd_face: My end goal is to become a software engineer or data scientist.
- :computer: Currently, I'm looking for either an apprenticeship or work with training in one of these fields :slightly_smiling_face:
