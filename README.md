- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Josh McCall, a 21 year old from Manchester looking to move into the field of programming.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve only just started my programming journey and I'm really enjoying it so far. I've completed the Responsive Web Design course on freecodecamp and I've dabbled with a bit of python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m now moving on to a JavaScript course while working through a few HTML/CSS and Python projects. I also have plans to complete a Python course and a couple of the AWS certificates. I'm really looking forward to what's to come! :grin:
- :nerd_face: My end goal is to either become a Software Developer, DevOps Engineer or even a Data Scientist.
- :computer: I'm currently looking for an apprenticeship or work (with training) in one of these fields :slightly_smiling_face: In the meantime, I'm going to continue with my self-learning and hopefully get a few projects under my belt to strengthen my portfolio!
